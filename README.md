## Experience with the Exercise 
It wasn't hard as I thought it would be as I continued to look through the code step by step. I started by looking through any kind of line that I did understand and used what I learned from creative coding to see what that line of code is trying to do. I recognized the ellipse tool and remembered its parameters: x, y, width, and height. 

I started to play around with the code, making a copy and messing around with its settings to see which elements controls what. From that point, it became easier to understand how the text graphics work and how it was created. I found functions draw and g(o) to be easier to understand than setup. 

I searched up the functions, elements, and operands that I didn't understand and used sites like MDN Foundation and W3Schools to find out how they work. I started gaining a little more understanding on how operators and arrays work. Overall, I found this exercise to be helpful.
